# Modules for SilverCart

SilverCart is build for modularity. New features can easily be integrated by developers by creating a new module. This way SilverCart itself can always be updated easily by overwriting its file directory. Updates will be done in very short time which saves you a lot of money.

We already developed several modules for SilverCart and there are many more to come. A developer just installs modules that fit your needs and your applications code base remains lean and maintainable.
