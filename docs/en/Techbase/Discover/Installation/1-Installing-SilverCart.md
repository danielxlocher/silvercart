# Installing SilverCart

Installing SilverCart is now just as easy as installing SilverStripe. As of version 1.2 we offer packages with SilverStripe, SilverCart and all required modules. After copying this package to your server you can run the SilverStripe installation script.

After the successful installation you will end up in the SilverCart frontend with its even more beautiful layout.
